    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>
        Welcome to my “About Me” page. On this page you will learn more about my personal life 
        that helped me to become who I am today. I will explain a brief overview of my family 
        and how that dynamic influenced my personal decisions growing up. Other stories such as 
        hobbies and extra-curricular activities will be shared through various photos. With each 
        photo I hope to share snippets of my life that better help the user to understand my 
        backstory. I love helping others and to better illustrate this point I will be sharing my 
        experiences serving as full-time missionary for my church and other volunteer projects I
        have been apart of. These experiences have been an integral part of my life and I wouldn't 
        change them. Through them I have been able to connect to others in ways that I would not have 
        been able to before. My hope is that through the showing of fun, but meaningful photos you 
        will gain a better visual understanding of these points in my life. If you would like to 
        learn more about my everyday life, there will be links in the footer of this page to personal 
        social media accounts such as Facebook, Instagram, and LinkedIn. There you will find updated 
        information about me and my current lifestyle.
