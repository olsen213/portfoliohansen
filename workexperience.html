    <h1>Work Experience</h1>

    <p>
        On this page you will find more information about the various jobs I have been able to do and 
        the experience I gained through them. I have been able to work with a variety of companies and 
        by doing so have learned how to adapt to new environments with varying challenges. The photos 
        on this page are designed to share some of those challenges I mentioned earlier and my takeaway 
        from them. With each photo, there will be information on the job assignment, its challenges, and 
        my personal contributions to help resolve them. Also on this site will be my most recent jobs and 
        what skills I was able to learn from them. At the very bottom of this page will be a short, ordered 
        list that quickly summarizes skills I have taken from different jobs and experiences. This page is 
        not intended to be an extensive list of every job I have had. Rather, this page gives a brief overview 
        of jobs that have increased my skills and helped me to become who I am today. If you have any questions 
        about any of the pages or would like to contact me, my information will be in the footer of this site 
        in the right-hand corner.
