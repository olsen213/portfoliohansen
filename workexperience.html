            <h1>Work Experience</h1>
            <p>
                On this page you will find more information about the various jobs I have been able to do and 
                the experience I gained through them. I have been able to work with a variety of companies and 
                by doing so have learned how to adapt to new environments with varying challenges. The photos 
                on this page are designed to share some of those challenges I mentioned earlier and my takeaway 
                from them. With each photo, there will be information on the job assignment, its challenges, and 
                my personal contributions to help resolve them. Also on this site will be my most recent jobs and 
                what skills I was able to learn from them. At the very bottom of this page will be a short, ordered 
                list that quickly summarizes skills I have taken from different jobs and experiences. This page is 
                not intended to be an extensive list of every job I have had. Rather, this page gives a brief overview 
                of jobs that have increased my skills and helped me to become who I am today. If you have any questions 
                about any of the pages or would like to contact me, my information will be in the footer of this site 
                in the right-hand corner.

                I have worked at several production line jobs and have learned to work efficiently under pressure while 
                staying calm. Two companies I have worked for that have taught me this are Lowers Food Inc, and Pepperidge
                Farm. At both places, I had to meet quota's as a team and working together was crucial to our overall success. 
                I learned to be aware of the environment around me and to step into uncomfortable situations to complete 
                unexpected tasks when they came up. Other aspects of these jobs included constantly looking for ways to improve 
                as a company. I can better identify problems quickly and correct them before causing bigger issues further on the 
                line because of these companies.

                I have worked on building frameworks for houses which have taught me practical skills needed to be successful in this 
                work area. While working with house-framing, I got to handle power tools, use various units of measurement, and listen 
                to contractors in the planning and execution of the day. I would also look at blue prints of the houses from time to time 
                and work with other builders to make sure we were following the plan. A typical day included making stairs, putting up siding 
                for various walls, and using pressurized tools for building with precision. Through this, I learned the value of endurance and 
                moving past mistakes in order to be successful. Making mistakes was part of the building process and always brought new opportunities 
                to learn from. I really enjoyed my time building houses.
