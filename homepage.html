                Hello and welcome to my website. My name is Olsen Hansen and I am happy that you 
                have taken the time to view my website. The purpose of this homepage is to introduce 
                you to the various pages of my website and get to know who I am better. On the top of
                this page, you will find a navigation bar that contain links to two separate pages labeled, 
                “About Me” and “Work Experiences.” As you click on the links there will be photos and 
                short details about my life that will help visually project who I am. Included on this 
                homepage is a short overview of what will be covered in the next two pages. If you get 
                lost navigating to the different pages, you can always go back to the various pages 
                through the hyper links at the header(top) and footer(bottom) of this page. Also located 
                on the footer portion of this home page you will see a “Site-plan.” If you click on this
                link, you will be directed to an overview of my website and how it is laid out. You will 
                also be able to see a brief overview of the content covered on each page in this site-plan. 
                Again, links are also provided to redirect the user to any page they wish to see.

                I am original from Haiti but was adopted at the age of four and moved to Cache Valley 
                Utah. I grew up in a small town within Cache Valley called Lewiston. There I learned 
                to I grew to love the outdoors and enjoy spending my time with family. As a family 
                we love camping, fishing, playing games, and watching movies. Being active is important 
                to me and throughout school I have participated in cross-country, track and field, baseball, 
                and basketball. I also enjoy listening to music and play the piano, cello, and recently have
                started learning songs on my ukulele. Outside of school activities, I value friendships and 
                getting to know new people. Everybody has a story to tell and I have learned so much from 
                the people around me. After highschool I was called to serve in the Barbados Bridgetown Mission 
                speaking French. There I met people from all over the world and learned many important values
                through them. The two years spent there taught me how to work hard despite the challenges
                and persevere to the end. It was a great two years and upon returning home have started
                college and am currently a student at BYU-Idaho.
