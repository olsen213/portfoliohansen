    <p>
        Hello and welcome to my website. My name is Olsen Hansen and I am happy that you 
        have taken the time to view my website. The purpose of this homepage is to introduce 
        you to the various pages of my website and get to know who I am better. On the top of
        this page, you will find a navigation bar that contain links to two separate pages labeled, 
        “About Me” and “Work Experiences.” As you click on the links there will be photos and 
        short details about my life that will help visually project who I am. Included on this 
        homepage is a short overview of what will be covered in the next two pages. If you get 
        lost navigating to the different pages, you can always go back to the various pages 
        through the hyper links at the header(top) and footer(bottom) of this page. Also located 
        on the footer portion of this home page you will see a “Site-plan.” If you click on this
        link, you will be directed to an overview of my website and how it is laid out. You will 
        also be able to see a brief overview of the content covered on each page in this site-plan. 
        Again, links are also provided to redirect the user to any page they wish to see.
