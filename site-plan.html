      <h3>Home page</h3>
      <p>
        Hello and welcome to my website. My name is Olsen Hansen and I am happy that you 
        have taken the time to view my website. The purpose of this homepage is to introduce 
        you to the various pages of my website and get to know who I am better. On the top of
        this page, you will find a navigation bar that contain links to two separate pages labeled, 
        “About Me” and “Work Experiences.” As you click on the links there will be photos and 
        short details about my life that will help visually project who I am. Included on this 
        homepage is a short overview of what will be covered in the next two pages. If you get 
        lost navigating to the different pages, you can always go back to the various pages 
        through the hyper links at the header(top) and footer(bottom) of this page. Also located 
        on the footer portion of this home page you will see a “Site-plan.” If you click on this
        link, you will be directed to an overview of my website and how it is laid out. You will 
        also be able to see a brief overview of the content covered on each page in this site-plan. 
        Again, links are also provided to redirect the user to any page they wish to see.

      <h3>About Me</h3>
      <p>
        Welcome to my “About Me” page. On this page you will learn more about my personal life 
        that helped me to become who I am today. I will explain a brief overview of my family 
        and how that dynamic influenced my personal decisions growing up. Other stories such as 
        hobbies and extra-curricular activities will be shared through various photos. With each 
        photo I hope to share snippets of my life that better help the user to understand my 
        backstory. I love helping others and to better illustrate this point I will be sharing my 
        experiences serving as full-time missionary for my church and other volunteer projects I
        have been apart of. These experiences have been an integral part of my life and I wouldn't 
        change them. Through them I have been able to connect to others in ways that I would not have 
        been able to before. My hope is that through the showing of fun, but meaningful photos you 
        will gain a better visual understanding of these points in my life. If you would like to 
        learn more about my everyday life, there will be links in the footer of this page to personal 
        social media accounts such as Facebook, Instagram, and LinkedIn. There you will find updated 
        information about me and my current lifestyle.

      </ul>
      <h3>Work Experiences</h3>
      <p>
        On this page you will find more information about the various jobs I have been able to do and 
        the experience I gained through them. I have been able to work with a variety of companies and 
        by doing so have learned how to adapt to new environments with varying challenges. The photos 
        on this page are designed to share some of those challenges I mentioned earlier and my takeaway 
        from them. With each photo, there will be information on the job assignment, its challenges, and 
        my personal contributions to help resolve them. Also on this site will be my most recent jobs and 
        what skills I was able to learn from them. At the very bottom of this page will be a short, ordered 
        list that quickly summarizes skills I have taken from different jobs and experiences. This page is 
        not intended to be an extensive list of every job I have had. Rather, this page gives a brief overview 
        of jobs that have increased my skills and helped me to become who I am today. If you have any questions 
        about any of the pages or would like to contact me, my information will be in the footer of this site 
        in the right-hand corner.
